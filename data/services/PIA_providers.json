      "detailedDescription": "My initial passion for helping people first began when I became a Physical Therapist over 25 years ago. Working directly with patients, it became apparent to me that many of my clients were struggling to understand their insurance, how it worked, and often they were on the wrong plan for their care needs. This often resulted in a decreased quality of care and an increased out of pocket expense to them.\nTherefore, it was a natural decision for me to start my own insurance agency. The passion and innate sense of advocacy I experienced as a Physical Therapist is what encompasses my insurance business. It is at the heart of how I approach each client’s needs.  \nCombining my medical experience and insurance experience provides a unique opportunity for me to be intimately familiar with the networks, medications, specialists, equipment companies and hospital systems. I see the big picture and can better understand my clients needs and assist them. \n I am appointed with many carriers and am an independent broker. This means I provide a consultation and proper plan with no cost to you and no conflict of interest that may arise by representing one company.   Although I live in California, I am able to provide insurance assist in any state. Together, we will work to find a solution that is always best for each individual situation.  Once a plan is chosen, I will be right there every step of the way now and in the future.",

They offer a wide range of in-home support services, including companion care, personal care and skilled nursing.  They also specialize in care for people with Parkinson’s and dementia.  Because BrightStar caregivers are trained and supported by a RN Nursing Director who watches over their clients and staff – something extremely rare for home care companies -- they can provide early detection and intervention when medical issues arise.  In fact, BrightStar clients are 25% less likely to be hospitalized compared to clients of other home care companies.\n\nBrightStar Care® of Carlsbad serves the Coastal North County area:  Carlsbad, Oceanside, Vista, La Costa, Ocean Hills, Bonsall, Fallbrook, and Camp Pendleton.",
